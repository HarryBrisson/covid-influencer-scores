see the impact of distancing measures in an agent-based model

created for the (CoViD-19 Global Hackathon)[https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/]

**problem**
many people still don't take social distancing seriously, limited its effectiveness as policy.  if they don't take it seriously, governments will have to elevate to lockdown measures which can put vulnerable populations (like those living alone and suffering from depression) at risk.  existing models and simulations have been too wonky to resonate with people less familiar with these styles of models and simulations.

**solution**
an agent-based model is less abstract than a plotted curve, showing how individual interactions drive outcomes.  the simulation should show how individual behavior and behavior changes at scale can change lives.
